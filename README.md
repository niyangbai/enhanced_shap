## Overview
Enhanced SHAP is a library designed to improve the interpretability of machine learning models for sequential and sparse data, particularly in the context of Predictive Process Monitoring. It extends the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework to handle complex data structures and provide more insightful explanations.

## Features
- Support for sequential and sparse data.
- Enhanced interpretability for predictive process monitoring tasks.
- Integration with popular machine learning frameworks.
- Customizable explanation methods for domain-specific use cases.

## Installation
To install the library, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git https://github.com/niyangbai/enhanced_shap.git
cd enhanced_shap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use Enhanced SHAP:

```python
from ESHAP import EnhancedSHAP

# Load your model and data
model = load_your_model()
data = load_your_data()

# Initialize Enhanced SHAP
explainer = EnhancedSHAP(model, data)

# Generate explanations
explanations = explainer.explain()

# Visualize explanations
explainer.visualize(explanations)
```

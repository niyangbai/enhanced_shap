"""
This module provides implementations of various distance metrics for comparing tensors.
It includes functions for computing Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance.
These metrics are useful for tasks such as clustering, similarity measurement, and sequence alignment.

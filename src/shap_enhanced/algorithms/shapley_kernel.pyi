"""
This module provides various kernel weight computation methods for use in Shapley value-based 
explanations. These methods include standard KernelSHAP weights, entropy-weighted kernel weights, 
and uniform kernel weights. Each method calculates the weight for a subset of features based on 
different criteria, allowing for flexibility in how feature importance is evaluated.

Functions:
- shapley_kernel_weights: Computes the standard KernelSHAP weight for a given subset size.
- entropy_kernel_weights: Computes an entropy-weighted kernel to penalize unbalanced coalitions.
- uniform_kernel_weights: Computes a uniform kernel weight where all subsets are equally weighted.

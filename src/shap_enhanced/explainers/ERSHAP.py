ER-SHAP: Ensemble of Random SHAP Explainer
==========================================

Theoretical Explanation
-----------------------

ER-SHAP is a computationally efficient, ensemble-based approximation of Shapley values, designed for
both sequential and tabular models. Instead of exhaustively enumerating all possible coalitions,
ER-SHAP repeatedly samples random subsets of feature–timestep positions and estimates their
marginal contributions to model output.

This stochastic approach significantly accelerates SHAP estimation while maintaining interpretability,
especially in high-dimensional or temporal settings. ER-SHAP also allows prior knowledge (e.g., feature importance)
to guide coalition sampling through weighted schemes.

Key Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Random Coalition Sampling**:
    For each position \\((t, f)\\), sample coalitions \\( C \\subseteq (T \times F) \\setminus \\{(t, f)\\} \\)
    and estimate the marginal contribution of \\((t, f)\\) by measuring its impact on model output.

- **Weighted Sampling**:
    Coalition sampling can be uniform or weighted based on prior feature importance scores
    or positional frequency, allowing informed, efficient sampling.

- **Flexible Masking**:
    Masked features are imputed using:
        - Zeros (hard masking).
        - Feature-wise means from the background dataset (soft masking).

- **Additivity Normalization**:
    Final attributions are scaled so that their sum matches the model output difference
    between the original and fully-masked input.

Algorithm
---------

1. **Initialization**:
    - Accepts a model, background dataset for imputation, number of sampled coalitions,
        masking strategy (`'zero'` or `'mean'`), weighting scheme, optional feature importance, and device context.

2. **Coalition Sampling**:
    - For each feature–timestep pair \\((t, f)\\):
        - Sample coalitions \\( C \\subseteq (T \times F) \\setminus \\{(t, f)\\} \\), either uniformly or using weights.
        - For each coalition:
            - Impute the coalition \\( C \\) in the input.
            - Impute the coalition \\( C \\cup \\{(t, f)\\} \\).
            - Compute the model output difference.
        - Average these differences to estimate the marginal contribution of \\((t, f)\\).

3. **Normalization**:
    - Scale the final attributions so that their total equals the difference in model output
        between the original input and a fully-masked baseline.

"""
SHAP Explainers Collection
==========================

Overview
--------

This subpackage contains a suite of SHAP-style explainers, each designed to handle different data structures,  
baseline strategies, and attribution mechanisms for interpretable machine learning. These explainers extend  
beyond standard SHAP to provide specialized techniques for:

- Temporal and sequential data (e.g., `TimeSHAP`, `LatentSHAP`)
- Sparse and discrete structures (e.g., `SPSHAP`, `SCSHAP`)
- Reinforcement learningâ€“based strategies (e.g., `RLSHAP`)
- Surrogate model approximations (e.g., `SurroSHAP`)
- Multi-baseline and enhanced SHAP variants

Each module implements the `BaseExplainer` interface to ensure interoperability and consistent SHAP output.

Modules
-------

- **LatentSHAP**: Attribution in the latent space of an autoencoder.
- **TimeSHAP**: Pruned SHAP for long temporal sequences.
- **SurroSHAP**: Fast SHAP via surrogate regression.
- **MBSHAP**: Multi-baseline SHAP with per-sample reference sets.
- **RLSHAP**: SHAP value estimation via policy gradient masking.
- **SPSHAP**: Support-preserving masking for sparse inputs.
- **SCSHAP**: Sparse coalition enumeration for binary or one-hot inputs.
- **... and more**: Variants prefixed with a unique identifier (e.g., `ESSHAP`, `ERSHAP`) for experimentation.

Usage
-----

Import individual explainers or use the package to programmatically register all variants:

\chapter{Introduction}
This \LaTeX \- template has been developed by the University of M\"unster and adapted by the Chair of Digital Industrial Service Systems at the \gls{FAU} to match the \gls{FAU} \gls{CD}. The file \path{main.tex} is the master file.

It was originally built by  Jan Betzing and Dominik Lekse and draws from the DBIS template by Till Haselmann and Florian Stahl, as well as from the IS template by Stephan Dlugosz. The adaption to FAU was done by Matthias Stierle. Currently, Sebastian Dunzer maintains the template.

This document is work-in-progress and provides instructions on how to use the template. It does not give advices on scientific writing.

Please feel free to contribute to this template.

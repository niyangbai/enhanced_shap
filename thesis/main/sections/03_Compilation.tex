\chapter{Compiling the document}
To generate a PDF-file from your \TeX-file on your own Latex distribution you need to run the following commands. We assume you have a master file \path{main.tex} that you want to typeset.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htp, caption={Commands to compile this document}, label={lst:compiling}, language=bash, morekeywords={pdflatex, bibtex, makeglossaries}]
pdflatex main
pdflatex main
makeglossaries main
bibtex main
pdflatex main
pdflatex main
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Known Issues}
Under some configurations on Windows machines, the \texttt{makeglossaries} command silently fails, which results in empty lists of accronyms and symbols. Same goes for the implicitly called \texttt{makeindex} command.
